	  - ‚òùüèΩRemember to specify the soil mixture for the specific cactus type
	  - Porous soil that doesn‚Äôt hold too much water is a key factor in cactus soil and should dry within a day or two. It should also consist of coarse particles, mixed with smaller amounts of organic material.
	    All these factors are crucial in order to prevents root rot.  
	  - Cactus potting mix is available in most plant centers, but can sometimes hold too much water (due to damage/grinding of particles resulting in this. Or can just be a poor mixture).
	    Making cactus soil can therefore be more beneficial for the plant.

	- The below components are just as well suited for soil mixture. But the preferred soils above are just a rule of thumb:
	- Non-organic components /such as:
		- #[[pumice]]
		- #[[perlite]]
		- #[[grit]] or #[[coarse sand]]
	-
	- And small amounts of organic components such as:
		- #[[organic potting mix]] / all purpose-potting soil. Standard potting soil can vary in compositions.
		- #[[pine bark]]  A substitute can be cocos coir chips or orchid bark.
		- #[[peat moss]]
