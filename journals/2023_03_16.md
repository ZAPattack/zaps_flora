- ### Notes:
	- Ivies are a relatively easy plant to care for and thrives well in most homes and climates. It can tolerate some neglect but will dry out if not given the minimum requirements such as water.
	- Side note: There are many Hedera species and even more cultivars. Some sites can't distinguish ivy species, resulting in confusion while documenting information about this genus. Therefore it is recommended to treat this information with caution. The "commercial" Hedera needs more or less the same care, and if the plant is bought at a plant centre, the change of it being a cultivar of the #[[Hedera Helix]] or other Hedera cultivars, suited for indoor, is possible.
	- ## 🤲🏼Care
	- 🌞Sun:
		- Most ivies does well in partly sunny places, but needs bright indirect light to thrive. It doesn't do well indoor when it's warm, dry and if the plant gets too much sun.
		- #[[Hedera algeriensis]] can tolerate full sun in a aerated climate, but will need more water.
		-
	- 💧Watering and humidity:
		-
		- In spring and summer, keep the soil a bit moist and not wet. Tolerates short periods of dry soils.
		- In winter and fall, reduce watering.
		- Mist once in a while and/or add humidifier. If either isn't possible, add tray and pebbles and water to give a slight humid area.
		-
	- 🧃Fertiliser:
		- It is not important to give ivies any fertiliser. But if the plant isn't growing/evolving and it is desired for it to do so, then proceed reading the points.
		- The most common answer as to which npk fertiliser is used is 20-20-20 diluted in half strength.
		- Fertilise once every second week in spring and summer.
		- (Never fertilise dry soil)
		-
	- 🪴Soil composition and potting:
		- Needs #[[loam]] type soils that have well draining properties. It is important that the soil can maintain a moist soil as well.
		- It is acceptable to use almost any type of soil, as sure as it's "soil needs" are met.
		- A composition would be of #[[loamy soil]] (2 parts #[[clay soil]], 1 part #[[sand]] and #[[pea-gravel]] or #[[silt]]. ) And add 1 part #[[perlite]].
		-
	- 🗡️Propagation: This method will make the cuttings ready for potting withing 6 weeks if conditions are met.
		- It is best to do these in spring or summer. But it can be done in most seasons if lucky.
		- Take at least 3 cuttings from relatively new stems to insure good results. (not too woody)
		- Make the stems at least 10 cm (~4 inches) and cut off the leafs that are positioned where the roots should be.
		- When cutting, make a little "wound" where the leafs have been.
		- Using sterile equipment is advised.
		- Either inset in glass of water or insert the cuttings in a water filled container.
		- Change water every two weeks or when the water turns murky. Try not to disturb and change water constantly.
