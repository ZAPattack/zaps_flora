	- Notes:
		- 🤲🏼Care:
			- A quite grateful plant that are easy to care for.
		- 🧪Uses:
			- For #[[wound healing]],  #[[sunburn]] or 2nd degree skin burn, the gel can be applied so that the skin may find relief and can focus on healing. Maybe because of its #[[anti-inflammatory]] and #[[antibacterial]] properties.
			- #[[Periodontitis]] is a dental affliction that results in sore, swollen, bleeding and/or recedings in the gums. Aleo Vera mouth was are used for treatment in relief or partly regeneration.
			- I cant find a single research paper concluding Aloe Vera gel being somewhat a health risk
		- ‼️Caution:
			- Do not consume or use part of the latex(second layer) from Aloe Vera.
			  High dosage of the latex can be unsafe and in some cases lethal. May cause kidney failure.
			- While some parts of the plant has proven beneficial, studies suggest that “whole leaf extract“ may have #[[tumor-promoting]] effects.
